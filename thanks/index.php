					<h5>Here at Team 4th dimension we greatly appreciate those who go above and beyond to help us achieve our goal.</h5>

This will enable us to improve our applications or to make your great idea into a reality with Team 4th Dimension.</p>

						<p><strong>Thank you Paul</strong> for your faith and interest in what we do here at Team 4th Dimension. Your generous investment means a lot to every single one of our team members. 
            The investment will make it possible for us to put LolHelper and all future applications on iOS. As our initial investor without you our dream 
            may have remained an idea.<br> Again, thank you from Team 4th Dimension.</p>
						<p><strong>Paul's personal statement:</strong>I could not be more excited for what you all at Team 4th Dimension are doing. I truly believe that the skills this team possesses will allow them to meet and go beyond any goals they set. I am confident in the LoLHelper application specifically because it has the capability to reach the market in ways that have not yet been done. I am looking forward to seeing what the future has for Team 4th Dimension.</p>
