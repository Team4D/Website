					<p>I'm a member of the design team of Team 4th Dimension. I work closely with my team members in creating and designing graphics and layouts for our clients. I provide rough sketches of designs that will evolve into polished designs ready to be displayed. I do most of my computer artwork through Adobe Illustrator.  As part of a team that is full of inspiration and ready to show what we can do, we collaborate together to get as many perspectives as possible and ensure our designs are original and is pleasing to the eyes.
          <br><br>
          Computers and art are my passions, when working with Team 4th Dimension, I always seek to improve my artwork and knowledge of computers. I have gone to UEI College for a degree as a Computer System Technician and graduated, and I am currently studying for certifications in the IT field. I enjoy paper and pencil drawing, reading, outdoor activities, and martial arts. Creativity, originality, and being open to ideas from others are qualities that I believe are important for an individual to grow. I am very excited to be a part of starting company and look forward to our future.

					<p>Hello, in late July Alexa Varady and I started this company after our software engineering team knocked the ball out of the park with our LolHelper application. As Chief Executive Officer and part-owner of Team 4th Dimension Software Solutions I organize team meetings and manage each of our separate development teams. I also attend meetings at the local business development center and work closely with marketing, advertising and design. As a client you will be in close contact with me from day one whether I am presenting with marketing, goings over contracts or relaying exactly what you are looking for to my design team. Of course I am always available via e-mail or phone for those spur of the moment ideas you have to put out there.<br><br>
          Even in my free time I am compelled to work towards a goal, whether it be progressing through a game, programming, guitar and bass practice or learning Japanese. I am a fairly competitive person and find great joy and motivation in friendly competition of any kind.  Japanese has been an interest of mine for years, but I had to put it on hold to pursue my CS degree. However, I definitely plan on becoming fluent in the near future. Socially, I consider myself outgoing and friendly, making me fun to be around even in stressful environments. Overall, I have a relaxed and pleasant demeanor about me and thrive under the pressure of racing to whatever finish line has been placed ahead of me.

					<p>As Project Progress Manager, I liaise with all teams in order to determine what resources each needs in order to complete their jobs on time.  Whatever the situation calls for be it pizza, overarching progression coordination, a sounding board to bounce ideas off of during design sessions, or a helping hand during crunch I’m there to make it happen. 
          <br><br>
          Studying Computer Science at the University of Kansas, I've focused in a broad array of subjects with my spare time to become a Jack of All Trades.  The more you know about a wider array of subject, then the better you can interface with other people on your team or in the public.  I enjoy long walks on the beach and In and Out burgers, which sucks because Kansas lacks both.
