				</div>
				<div id="counters" class="tab-content">
					<h2>Counters</h2>

					<p>Our process begins with a deep brainstorming session. We meet with each person involved in the process&mdash;from your team and ours&mdash;to have their individual input included. This master list is then pared down, separating the chaff from the wheat, and expanded upon to create the abstract overview of tasks to complete the project.</p>

					<p>After that introductory meeting, we break into teams to attack the generated task list head on. Each sub team is tasked with a single slice of the overarching task outline. By taking each part of the whole and treating it as a module we not only create a more functional end product, we complete it so fast that you'll wonder why you didn't come to us sooner.</p>
