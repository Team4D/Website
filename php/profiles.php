			'<p>Hello, in late July, Alexa Varady and I started this company after our software engineering team knocked the ball out of the park with our LolHelper application. As Chief Executive Officer and part-owner of Team 4th Dimension Software Solutions, I organize team meetings and manage each of our separate development teams. I also attend meetings at the local business development center and work closely with marketing, advertising, and design. As a client, you will be in close contact with me from day one whether I am presenting with marketing, going over contracts, or relaying exactly what you are looking for to my design team. Of course, I am always available via e-mail or phone for those spur-of-the-moment ideas you have to put out there.</p>
			<p>Even in my free time I am compelled to work toward a goal, whether it be progressing through a game, programming, guitar and bass practice, or learning Japanese. I am a fairly competitive person and find great joy and motivation in friendly competition of any kind.  Japanese has been an interest of mine for years, but I had to put it on hold to pursue my CS degree. However, I definitely plan on becoming fluent in the near future. Socially, I consider myself outgoing and friendly, making me fun to be around even in stressful environments. Overall, I have a relaxed and pleasant demeanor about me and thrive under the pressure of racing to whatever finish line has been placed ahead of me.</p>'
